struct Person {
  uint age;
  string name;
}

Person[] public people;

// Now we're going to learn how to create new Persons and add them to our people array.
// create a New Person:
Person satoshi = Person(172, "Satoshi");

// Add that person to the Array:
people.push(satoshi);

// We can also combine these together and do them in one line of code to keep things clean:
people.push(Person(16, "Vitalik"));


// Note that array.push() adds something to the end of the array, so the elements are in the order we added them. See the following example:

uint[] numbers;
numbers.push(5);
numbers.push(10);
numbers.push(15);
// numbers is now equal to [5, 10, 15]
